# Kronecker-based CS Recovery for ECG Data -- ARCHIVED

# This repository has been **archived** and the work has been **ported** to a new final project:

## About this project

This repository is a **fork** of [Hadi Zanddizari's repository](https://github.com/hadizand/DL_CS_ECG), which originally contained MATLAB code for compressive sensing recovery of ECG data using the Kronecker technique and Adaptive Dictionary Learning. (refer to newest project for all info).

In this project, the original MATLAB code was **ported to Python**, but it is now part of the larger, final project found at the new repository. For all further developments and updates, please visit:
